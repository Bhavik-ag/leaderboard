      "text": "@nihal467   This project is interesting, and I m looking forward to contributing to this work in the C4GT 2023.\r\n\r\nI have over 2 years of experience working with Technologies Like React for the frontend, nodejs, and Express for the backend. I'm a Full Stack Web developer and have worked with MERN stack. I have experience working in the open-source community and have contributed to numerous organisations. I have worked with Cypress in the past, so it will have a low learning curve, and I can start working on it.\r\n\r\nSo should I connect with the mentors or submit the proposal?"
