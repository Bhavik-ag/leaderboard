So, along with the backend, that will also need to be modified right?\r\nAlso, in the backend, we need to append a new choice in the BedTypeChoices and that should suffice right?"

I have set up the frontend repository and am currently trying to understand the codebase while reading the documentation. Is there anything else you'd recommend to get started with this project?\r\n\r\nWith warm regards,\r\nJahnab Dutta"
