      "text": "Hey , i would like to take up this one.\r\n\r\nAs far i understand, we would need to create a periodic_task using celery that would run maybe every midnight to delete all the notifications that are older than 90 days.\r\n\r\nbut can we specify a few things for me,\r\n- Like what would be a great place to create this scheduler function(maybe inside a new file - `care/facility/tasks/notification/delete_older_notifications.py`)??\r\n- period/Time to run the task(maybe every midnight)??\r\n- I cant see a `created_at` field so do we need to decide this 90 days older on basis upon `read_at` field which exists in Notification table or add a `created_at` field to the table??\r\n"
